# resume
I originally from China but I currently living in Atlanta, I have been living in the us for about 5 years to pursue my education. I am in my last semester for computer science. 
I was an intern last summer as software engineer, but right now I am looking for a full time job. I have decent experience in website development using javascript, Node.js, Express, React.
Actually being a software developer is kind of my passion and a hobby. So I like it a lot. I also like basketball, hiking, traveling, and a good meal.
